# CLIPEval Implicit Polarity of Events
## 🔍 What Are Hidden (Implicit) Sentiments of Events?

- Hidden or **implicit sentiments** are emotions expressed **without using direct sentiment words** (like "happy" or "sad").
- The sentiment is inferred from the **event and context**.
- **Example**:  
  - *"He lost his job."* → Negative sentiment, even though no negative word is used.

## ⚠️ Why Is This a Challenge?

- **No explicit sentiment clues** — traditional models rely on sentiment words.
- **Context-dependent** — the same event can have different meanings in different situations.
- **Requires background knowledge** — understanding real-world implications of events.
- **Subtle expressions** — irony or indirect language is difficult for machines to interpret.

## 🎯 Project Objective

- Use the **CLIPEval** framework to **detect and classify implicit sentiment** of events as **positive, negative, or neutral**.
- Focus on **context-aware analysis**, without relying on obvious emotional keywords.
- Improve NLP systems' ability to understand **emotional tone and intent** behind real-world events.
